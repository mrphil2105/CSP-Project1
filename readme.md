# CSP-Project1
Computer Systems Performance - Project 1 (Partitioning Techniques)

## Running the project

1. Run the experimentations using command `make clean && make all && make run_all`
2. If visualization of the results is desired then run `python scripts/visualize_perf.py` and `python scripts/visualize_results.py `
3. If step 2 fails due to missing dependencies install them and go back to step 2
